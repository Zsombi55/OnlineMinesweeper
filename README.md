# OnlineMinesweeper
Personal "Minesweeper clone" project while learning JavaScript.

I have some basic HTML and CSS experience with near nil JS. I have decided that, I would like top become a web developer therefore, I am about to start learning JavaScript. I am attending a WD course where I will get "hands-on" help to achieve my goal faster than I would otherwise, alone. This is a side project which when done will be included in my up-coming online CV and portfolio.

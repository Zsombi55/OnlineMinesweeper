# OnlineMinesweeper
Personal "Minesweeper clone" project while learning JavaScript.

I have some basic HTML and CSS experience with a little JS. I have decided that, I would like to become a web developer therefore, I have started to learn JavaScript.

This is a personal project which when done will be included in my up-coming online CV and portfolio.
